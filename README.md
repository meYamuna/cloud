All the input fields are necessary to submit the form. Create two buttons Submit and Reset. Reset will reset the form while clicking on submit, all these are created by using survey.html and by using survey.js , it will check all the fields and necessary validations and then a popup will appear displaying all the selected values with labels in front of it. On closing the popup, the form should reset all the values.
